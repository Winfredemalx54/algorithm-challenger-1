Joint revision by Mathematical Reviews and Zentralblatt für Mathematik (done 2007 – 2009)

This wiki version of the current MSC was initialized in July 2007 with MSC2000 by Patrick Ion at MR/AMS. It was designed to be collaboratively editable by editorial staff of Mathematical Reviews and Zentralblatt für Mathematik so as to produce this joint draft of a proposed MSC2010 ready in January 2009. It now represents the final state of the revision process, namely our MSC2010 usable from July 2009.
